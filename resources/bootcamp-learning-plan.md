### What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?

First off, let me say that I want to ensure that what I learn during Dev Academy is applied in a professional environment, regardless of any fun projects I may build. I did mention being a videogame developer previously, but I now feel a greater need to discover how web development translates to the real world and then how to apply that to the greater benefit of my community. With great power comes greater responsibility. I can't remember where I heard that, but it seems like sage advice. I think one of my uncles said it in a drunken stupor.

### What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?

As I made my way through Foundations, there were some additions to my dynamic list of strengths and limitations, some glaring and some inconspicuous. My process for problem solving is under constant scrutiny, and that could be good or bad depending on what refinements I make. I am hoping this will aid me in completing my work, even if it is purely from a technical standpoint.

If we are being completely honest, I compare myself to others, much to my detriment. It doesn't help that we are bombarded by ads every time we walk in public or scroll through social media, reminding us to take another supplement, wear the latest fashion trend, or buy a gym membership. I have to be comfortable with my abilities and only improve in a safe and affirmative manner.

### What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be, and what would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

My biggest non-technical challenge in Bootcamp will be how I will handle the symptoms of my ADHD. Living with ADHD is tough, and coming up with my own plan hasn't worked in the past (on numerous occasions), so the best tactic, I feel, is enlisting a specialist who can help formulate effective strategies to positively impact the traits I need to be successful while counteracting the behaviors that work against my well-being. This has far-reaching implications for the relationships in my life and how I shine the spotlight on myself.

I would love to get back to a respectable level of health, as it tends to take a backseat, especially when I get heavily involved in a field of interest that captures my imagination. Too many times I will create a plan to work on my fitness or to eat well among other areas I can fit in, and yet I find myself back at square one. My expectation is that it will have a flow-on effect and improve my life in more ways than one.

There are many other areas to consider, but those challenges have an immediate effect on my chance of success in this course.

### What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?

Judging from what I have experienced so far, I have no reason to expect anything but great support from the Bootcamp team. I have no real way of knowing, still I would rather be an optimist than the opposite.

Reading ahead in the handbook has revealed that students will work collaboratively on many projects, so I imagine adding support to facilitate working together both locally and in remote environments. I am more independent than most, though, and don't really have expectations beyond what is deemed standard, so take this with a grain of salt.

### What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp

As long as I put a plan in place for each day on how I will manage my workload and remind myself why I am here on this course, I can't see myself failing. My existing plan currently has detailed time blocks for study, free time, and managing my day-to-day activities. I intend to use week 6 to refine this plan and seek guidance from facilitators about what support they can offer me in achieving my goals.

I want to always be learning, yet not so much that I lose sight of who I am and my intentions in this world.
