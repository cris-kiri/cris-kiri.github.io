## Core Reflection

### What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
It has been quite a journey and I have taken the liberty of traversing each sprint to reflect on the three standout questions asked of me during Foundations:

1. I've come to terms with the fact that I am a programmer at heart, as problem-solving comes naturally to me while I adopt a constant love for learning. This has evolved into a dynamic sense of knowing the corrective approach to take in order to problem-solve. Despite my attempts to tilt toward one end of the spectrum, my efforts end up in a balance between the logical and creative.
2. My Emotional Intelligence seems all over the place, and I pin this down to being more sensitive to emotions and stimuli around me. I am less prone to speak up in social interactions as it can be VERY exhausting, nevertheless I will partake if asked. As long as I can somehow regulate this, it won't end up being a liability. I know as well as you that we have no true control over our emotions, much akin to the return value of a random number function.
3. I value effort above individual ability. Too many people, including myself, rest on their laurels over gaining valuable experience in a seemingly fruitless event when maintaining one's integrity and removing your ego from the equation is a better course of action. Technical merit only gets us so far whereas being more in tune with our inner selves has greater ramifications on how we are perceived by our peers.

### What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
Each plays an important role in both learning and programming by influencing an individual's behavior and decision-making, understand and feelings and perspectives of others, while understanding your own thoughts, feelings and emotions. For instance, you may value accessibility and prioritize creating user interfaces that pay particular attention to users with disabilities. Showing empathy towards your fellow team members helps foster effective communication and experiences. By being self-conscious of personal biases, you allow for your own growth to become a programmer who creates more inclusive applications.

### What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
At first, I couldn't see the value of core learning and the transition away from focusing solely on the technical elements of development. But I see the foolishness of such an idea. To me, core learning is that important component that is lacking from much of the learning process, particularly in the workplace and among most education institutions.

### What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
For me it was not giving life to that disparaging voice within as in this manner it would play gatekeeper to realising my authentic self. There was much soul-searching to be done and have made some ground in that respect however its a forever thing that demands attention on a daily basis.

### Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
Because it's not just about writing code; it's about bridging the gap between we as humans and what technology has to offer. It is natural for us, as humans, to take control of our domain, and programming is just that. It asks us "How can we take a powerful tool and make it work for us in our best interests?". On the flip side, it is powerful to offer what it means to be human and inject that into our programming. They must work in harmony.

### Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?Justify your answer.

Oh, hell no. Quite the contrary, my dear. It has only reaffirmed that I should place more value on this aspect of learning. Admittedly, I have struggled, but I have loved and embraced my fallacies, as they have given me the building blocks to persevere and re-establish a base to get back on track.
