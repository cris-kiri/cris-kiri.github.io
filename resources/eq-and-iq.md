# EQ and IQ

## What is Emotional Intelligence?

Emotional Intelligence is how you use, understand, manage, and perceive not only your own emotions but recognize the emotions of others. These can be distilled down to a number of key elements:
- Self Awareness - being conscious of emotional states
- Self-regulation - not being impulsive with actions
- Social Awareness -  tuned into the experience of others
- Conflict Management Skills - ???

## How is EQ different to IQ?

Instead of looking at the **intellectual** ability of a person such as problem solving, planning, understanding of complex and abstract ideas, we look at how a person thinks, understands and responds to the **emotional** states of people and have the awareness to guide their own behavior. Its information versus behavior.

## Why is EQ important?

> Emotional intelligence can lead us on the path to a fulfilled and happy life by providing a framework through which to apply standards of intelligence to emotional responses and understand that these responses may be logically consistent or inconsistent with particular beliefs about emotion.

This sums the importance of EQ. Put in your own terms.
