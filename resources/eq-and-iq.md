# EQ and IQ

## What is Emotional Intelligence?

Emotional Intelligence is how you use, understand, manage, and perceive not only your own emotions but recognize the emotions of others. These can be distilled down to a number of key elements:
- Self Awareness - being conscious of emotional states
- Self-regulation - not being impulsive with actions
- Social Awareness - tuned into the experience of others

People with higher levels of emotional intelligence show empathy towards others, greater awareness and help facilitate growth and insight.

## How is EQ different to IQ?

IQ and EQ are both measurements of two different set of thinking skills. Instead of looking at the **intellectual** ability of a person such as problem solving, planning, understanding of complex and abstract ideas, we look at how a person thinks, understands and responds to the **emotional** states of people as well as the awareness to guide their own behavior. IQ has been the primary evaluation of human intelligence but with the acceptance of EQ, together they provide a more detailed picture.

## Why is EQ important?

Emotional Intelligence is often linked to career success and stronger relationships leading to a more happy and fulfilled life. It helps improve decision making, managing stressful moments, and enables a better social environment in the workplace.
