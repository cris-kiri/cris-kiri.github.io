## Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

### Blocked on a simple problem...

A simple problem also has a simple solution—an issue with a clear cause and effect. I didn't identify it as such because my ego believed my logic was sound and the tests were relevant. Finishing what should have been an easy exercise a few tests later would have me believe otherwise. No amount of research or examining my code had the desired outcome, so I stepped away for a bit and decided the best approach was to examine each character and each line. Until... there it was. There! Can you see it? Because I didn't 30 minutes ago. A missing pair of brackets at the end of a function. ARRGGH!!! I should celebrate that success, and for those with some knowledge about coding, it can seem like a glaring omission, but trust me when I say it can make or break someone. I had a little laugh at myself, though. I hope this serves as a stark reminder to exercise some patience while problem-solving and save some extra gray hairs sprouting from your scalp.

### Elegantly solved a problem...

Elegant may not be the correct word (it was already solved), but simplifying my code for a particular challenge involved removing unnecessary parts and using a different structure that made it easier to follow what was going on. I removed 11 lines of code, which included accompanying tests and some useless variables, which became 2 lines. I guess sloppy code is a problem, and improving readability can be seen as problem-solving. As I become more familiar with Javascript features and apply best practices, my aim is to write succinct code with a clear and concise process to achieve my goals.

### Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:

**Pseudocode:** This is my first port of call. I understand the problem better when I break it into smaller, more manageable chunks, further developing my focus and making me less inundated.
**Trying something:** This technique I feel like I excel in, but I must be careful as I can go down a rabbit hole and might not surface for air for a long time.
**Rubber ducky method:** I am willing to try this technique and have made preparations should I encounter a tough problem. Now to look online for my own rubber ducky...
**Reading error messages:** There is enough information in an error message to give you a good starting point. I would also advise using MDN's comprehensive reference list for all the errors you can encounter. My comprehension of error messages has increased over the last two weeks.
**Console.logging:** Half of the battle of using console logging is knowing where to use it and then configure each entry to display supporting information for debugging.
**Googling:** I am a 5th Dan Black Belt in Google-Fu and have represented Gisborne in the Nationals for a record of 16 entries. I'm still yet to make it out of the first round.
**Asking your peers for help:** It's not that I don't want to ask my peers; it's my nature to solve problems. Elitist much ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
**Asking coaches for help:** Same as above, but I feel confident my facilitators would know how to guide me in achieving a solution.
**Improving your process with reflection:** This is something I feel like I can be successful at and use on a regular basis. I can't help but move on to the next challenge (for coding, at least) without looking to improve my process and ensure that I fully grasp the material. I am making more of a conscious effort starting this week. 

#### Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?

To be frank, I don't ask for help too often because I see it as a chance to make those connections on my own, seeing as my brain works in mysterious ways. The opportunity will present itself, I am sure.
