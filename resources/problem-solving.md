## Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

### Blocked on a simple problem...

So I finished what should have been a simple problem and it was except for the fact that I omitted a crucial part of a function: the parentheses; the function will not have executed when I needed it to. I used some simple tests to determine the output but to no avail. So I read over more articles online just to be doubly sure I was correct with the logic and read through my code again. It was simply a failure to read the output of the test as it gave some vital clues as to where to look in my code and after this realisation, I had a little laugh to myself as it could have been remedied by exercising some patience and reading through slowly what was presented to me.


### Elegantly solved a problem...

Elegantly might not be the word for it (it was already solved) but simplyfying my code for the `capatilize.js` challenge within the `5-builtin-methods` kata involved some rewriting that not only made it easier to read but removed so many unnecessary parts. To put it in perspective, I removed 11 lines of code, which included accompanying tests and 5 useless variables, and brought it down to just 1 line. I guess having bad code is a problem so working on making it more readable can be seen as solving a problem. Becoming familiar with the more relevant features of Javascript is helping me write more succinct code and leads me to better convey the process of my solution.


### Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:

- **Pseudocode**
  - fairly confident. As long as I understand the problem, writing out the steps comes easy
- **Trying something**
  - very confident but I must be careful as I can go down a rabbit-hole and might not surface for air for a long time
- **Rubber ducky method**
  - I have yet to make use of the technique but have done some preparation should I encounted a particularly tough problem
- **Reading error messages**
  - Did you read what I wrote above??? Jokes aside I am fairly confident in comprehending output of rudimentary error messages
- **Console.logging**
  - I think the trick with console.log() messages is knowing where to use it in your code (usually after you assign some new values) and also using them in the console section of the browser dev tools. So I am confident.
- **Googling**
  - I am a 5th dan Black Belt in Google-Fu and have represented Gisborne in the Nationals for a record of 16 entries. Still yet to make it out of the first round though...
- **Asking your peers for help**
  - Its not that I don't need to ask my peers, I would often solve the problem using other techniques before I do so.
- **Asking coaches for help**
  - Same as above but I feel confident they would know how to guide me in achieving an solution.
- **Improving your process with reflection**
  - Now this is something I feel like I can be successful in and use it on a regular basis, but I can't help but move on to the next challenge (for coding at least) without looking at ways to improve my process and ensure that I fully grasp the material.

Out of the listed problem-solving techniques I feel most confident with Googling and trying something. And the least confident with reflection and asking for help from someone other than myself.


#### Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?

As noted above, I don't ask for help so am very reluctant. I feel self-confident in coming to a solution and see it as a chance to make those connections on my own seeing as my brain works in mysterious ways. Elitist much perhaps ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
