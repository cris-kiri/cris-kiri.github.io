### Wellbeing plan using Te Whare Tapa Whā

These are the activities I have chosen to focus on for each wall in the "Te Whare Tapa Wha" model. I think these are achievable each week because I already spend time doing some of the activities but know that I spend too much time on others or wasting my time on unneccessary tasks.

| WALL |	ACTIVITIES | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Taha Tinana (Physical) |	Walk at least 30min a day | Complete my strength training routine |
| Taha Whānau (Family) | Strengthen my relationship with my Wife | Cook and share a family dinner once a week |
| Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental) |	Meditate first thing each morning | Read a chapter of a book each night |
| Taha Wairua (Spiritual) |	Spend time on reflecting on my values and identity | Challenge myself to see the best in people |
| Whenua (Foundations) |	Take the time to notice nature around me | Practice living more sustainably |
