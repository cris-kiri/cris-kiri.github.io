        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h4>
        <h4>Blocked on a simple problem...</h4>
        <p>
          A simple problem also has a simple solution—an issue with a clear
          cause and effect. I didn't identify it as such because my ego believed
          my logic was sound and the tests were relevant. Finishing what should
          have been an easy exercise a few tests later would have me believe
          otherwise. No amount of research or examining my code had the desired
          outcome, so I stepped away for a bit and decided the best approach was
          to examine each character and each line. Until... there it was. There!
          Can you see it? Because I didn't 30 minutes ago. A missing pair of
          brackets at the end of a function. ARRGGH!!! I should celebrate that
          success, and for those with some knowledge about coding, it can seem
          like a glaring omission, but trust me when I say it can make or break
          someone. I had a little laugh at myself, though. I hope this serves as
          a stark reminder to exercise some patience while problem-solving and
          save some extra gray hairs sprouting from your scalp.
        </p>
        <h4>Elegantly solved a problem...</h4>
        <p>
          Elegant may not be the correct word (it was already solved), but
          simplifying my code for a particular challenge involved removing
          unnecessary parts and using a different structure that made it easier
          to follow what was going on. I removed 11 lines of code, which
          included accompanying tests and some useless variables, which became 2
          lines. I guess sloppy code is a problem, and improving readability can
          be seen as problem-solving. As I become more familiar with Javascript
          features and apply best practices, my aim is to write succinct code
          with a clear and concise process to achieve my goals.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques/processes:
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> This is my first port of call. I
          understand the problem better when I break it into smaller, more
          manageable chunks, further developing my focus and making me less
          inundated.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Trying something:</strong> This technique I feel like I excel
          in, but I must be careful as I can go down a rabbit hole and might not
          surface for air for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I am willing to try this
          technique and have made preparations should I encounter a tough
          problem. Now to look online for my own rubber ducky...
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> There is enough information
          in an error message to give you a good starting point. I would also
          advise using MDN's comprehensive reference list for all the errors you
          can encounter. My comprehension of error messages has increased over
          the last two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Console.logging:</strong> Half of the battle of using console
          logging is knowing where to use it and then configure each entry to
          display supporting information for debugging.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Googling:</strong> I am a 5th Dan Black Belt in Google-Fu and
          have represented Gisborne in the Nationals for a record of 16 entries.
          I'm still yet to make it out of the first round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> It's not that I don't
          want to ask my peers; it's my nature to solve problems. Elitist much
          ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> Same as above, but I feel
          confident my facilitators would know how to guide me in achieving a
          solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> This is
          something I feel like I can be successful at and use on a regular
          basis. I can't help but move on to the next challenge (for coding, at
          least) without looking to improve my process and ensure that I fully
          grasp the material. I am making more of a conscious effort starting
          this week.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          To be frank, I don't ask for help too often because I see it as a
          chance to make those connections on my own, seeing as my brain works
          in mysterious ways. The opportunity will present itself, I am sure.
