        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h4>
        <h4>Blocked on a simple problem...</h4>
        <p>
          So I finished what should have been a simple problem and it was except
          for the fact that I omitted a crucial part of a function: the
          parentheses; the function will not have executed when I needed it to.
          I used some simple tests to determine the output but to no avail. So I
          read over more articles online just to be doubly sure I was correct
          with the logic and read through my code again. It was simply a failure
          to read the output of the test as it gave some vital clues as to where
          to look in my code and after this realisation, I had a little laugh to
          myself as it could have been remedied by exercising some patience and
          reading through slowly what was presented to me.
        </p>
        <h4>Elegantly solved a problem...</h4>
        <p>
          Elegantly might not be the word for it (it was already solved) but
          simplyfying my code for the <code>capatilize.js</code> challenge
          within the <code>5-builtin-methods</code> kata involved some rewriting
          that not only made it easier to read but removed so many unnecessary
          parts. To put it in perspective, I removed 11 lines of code, which
          included accompanying tests and 5 useless variables, and brought it
          down to just 1 line. I guess having bad code is a problem so working
          on making it more readable can be seen as solving a problem. Becoming
          familiar with the more relevant features of Javascript is helping me
          write more succinct code and leads me to better convey the process of
          my solution.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques/processes:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                fairly confident. As long as I understand the problem, writing
                out the steps comes easy
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trying something</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                very confident but I must be careful as I can go down a
                rabbit-hole and might not surface for air for a long time
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I have yet to make use of the technique but have done some
                preparation should I encounted a particularly tough problem
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Did you read what I wrote above??? Jokes aside I am fairly
                confident in comprehending output of rudimentary error messages
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I think the trick with console.log() messages is knowing where
                to use it in your code (usually after you assign some new
                values) and also using them in the console section of the
                browser dev tools. So I am confident.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Googling</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I am a 5th dan Black Belt in Google-Fu and have represented
                Gisborne in the Nationals for a record of 16 entries. Still yet
                to make it out of the first round though...
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Its not that I don't need to ask my peers, I would often solve
                the problem using other techniques before I do so.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Same as above but I feel confident they would know how to guide
                me in achieving an solution.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Now this is something I feel like I can be successful in and use
                it on a regular basis, but I can't help but move on to the next
                challenge (for coding at least) without looking at ways to
                improve my process and ensure that I fully grasp the material.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Out of the listed problem-solving techniques I feel most confident
          with Googling and trying something. And the least confident with
          reflection and asking for help from someone other than myself.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          As noted above, I don't ask for help so am very reluctant. I feel
          self-confident in coming to a solution and see it as a chance to make
          those connections on my own seeing as my brain works in mysterious
          ways. Elitist much perhaps ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯
