        <h3>Core Reflections</h3>
        <h4>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
          It has been quite a journey and I have taken the liberty of traversing
          each sprint to reflect on the three standout questions asked of me
          during Foundations:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I've come to terms with the fact that I am a programmer at heart, as
            problem-solving comes naturally to me while I adopt a constant love
            for learning. This has evolved into a dynamic sense of knowing the
            corrective approach to take in order to problem-solve. Despite my
            attempts to tilt toward one end of the spectrum, my efforts end up
            in a balance between the logical and creative.
          </li>
          <li>
            My Emotional Intelligence seems all over the place, and I pin this
            down to being more sensitive to emotions and stimuli around me. I am
            less prone to speak up in social interactions as it can be VERY
            exhausting, nevertheless I will partake if asked. As long as I can
            somehow regulate this, it won't end up being a liability. I know as
            well as you that we have no true control over our emotions, much
            akin to the return value of a random number function.
          </li>
          <li>
            I value effort above individual ability. Too many people, including
            myself, rest on their laurels over gaining valuable experience in a
            seemingly fruitless event when maintaining one's integrity and
            removing your ego from the equation is a better course of action.
            Technical merit only gets us so far whereas being more in tune with
            our inner selves has greater ramifications on how we are perceived
            by our peers.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Each plays an important role in both learning and programming by
          influencing an individual's behavior and decision-making, understand
          and feelings and perspectives of others, while understanding your own
          thoughts, feelings and emotions. For instance, you may value
          accessibility and prioritize creating user interfaces that pay
          particular attention to users with disabilities. Showing empathy
          towards your fellow team members helps foster effective communication
          and experiences. By being self-conscious of personal biases, you allow
          for your own growth to become a programmer who creates more inclusive
          applications.
        </p>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          At first, I couldn't see the value of core learning and the transition
          away from focusing solely on the technical elements of development.
          But I see the foolishness of such an idea. To me, core learning is
          that important component that is lacking from much of the learning
          process, particularly in the workplace and among most education
          institutions.
        </p>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          For me it was not giving life to that disparaging voice within as in
          this manner it would play gatekeeper to realising my authentic self.
          There was much soul-searching to be done and have made some ground in
          that respect however its a forever thing that demands attention on a
          daily basis.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Because it's not just about writing code; it's about bridging the gap
          between we as humans and what technology has to offer. It is natural
          for us, as humans, to take control of our domain, and programming is
          just that. It asks us &quot;How can we take a powerful tool and make
          it work for us in our best interests?&quot;. On the flip side, it is
          powerful to offer what it means to be human and inject that into our
          programming. They must work in harmony.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead?Justify your answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Oh, hell no. Quite the contrary, my dear. It has only reaffirmed that
          I should place more value on this aspect of learning. Admittedly, I
          have struggled, but I have loved and embraced my fallacies, as they
          have given me the building blocks to persevere and re-establish a base
          to get back on track.
