        <h3>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h3>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h4>
        <p>
          During a very rough work shift, I encountered an extremely rude
          customer that refused to listen about a policy that disallowed her
          from receiving a refund. After some abuse came my way and raised her
          voice, I was faced with dealing with the situation personally or
          elevating the problem to a manager. My limited encounters with
          handling such a situation may have jeopardized the professionalism of
          the business so I decided on the latter. The customer may not have got
          their way but it helped in maintaining the standards of the workplace
          and other customers notice these behaviors.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I am a very “inward” person so I am not influenced by those around me
          and march to my own drums. I do look at those people more outside my
          circle like successful people around the world who have added value to
          the people that surround them and those who they influence around the
          world.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I have an unquenchable love of learning so being part of the
          ever-evolving world of Web Development and partaking in such an
          exciting and innovative industry will aid in fostering that part of
          me.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I am very detail-oriented and this can be work for me but mostly
          against me. I tend to lose interest quickly if I don’t find something
          engaging and fun.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I can’t recall any major situations but small moments dealing with
          fellow staff members not pulling their weight or treating others
          poorly where I would either speak with their superiors or lead by
          example. Now I would speak with people about my concerns directly if
          it truly troubles me.
