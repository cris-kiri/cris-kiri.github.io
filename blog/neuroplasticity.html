        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <h4>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people
        </h4>
        <p>
          We often lament at the idea you are left with the cards your dealt and
          have no say in life but this attitude only serves to hold you back.
          Yes knowledge and skills degrade over time, essentially &quot;use it
          or lose&quot;, but all is not lost because we can re-establish those
          lost neural links through re-engagement and repetition. For instance
          it takes a great number of praticing hours to learn an instrument.
          Take extensive time away from that and you may find it hard to play
          anything when you pick it up later on. You can simply get back into
          the rhythm of practice to catch up again.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit
        </h4>
        <p>
          I want to establish a level of consistency with practicing the core
          and tech skills of being a web developer. I have a love of learning
          but often remiss in keeping and maintaining that knowledge. I have set
          aside time in the afternoon to go over my notes and further deepen my
          knowledge in the learning material of the day through extra research
          in my own time.
        </p>
        <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            regular utilisation to combat degradation eg &quot;use it or lose
            it&quot;
          </li>
          <li>
            applying sufficient intensity. The more intensive the training, the
            greater the results achieved
          </li>
          <li>tailor your training to a specific ativity in a desired area</li>
          <li>
            repetition goes a long way in strengthening the connections in your
            neural networks
          </li>
          <li>applying your skills to real-world situations</li>
        </ul>

          Also I wanted to leave this story about actress Emilia Clark who had a
          series of life-threatening aneurysms that left parts of her brain
          damaged yet she maintains that she leads a normal life. Her brain had
          to forge new synaptic links to compensate for the parts that were not
          receiving blood flow anymore. This is an example of Functional
          Plasticity.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h4>
        <p>
          As described by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck and some of her
          collegues, it is &quot;the belief that a persons capacities and
          talents can be improved over time&quot;. In other words, talents are
          not set in stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can be our own worse enemies holding yourself back from achieving
          your goals in life mearly thinking that you aren't good enough. This
          is known as a fixed mindset. It's like that old saying:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&quot;You can't teach an old dog new tricks&quot;
</code></pre>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is in complete contrast to this and becomes relevant
          when we seek to improve certain areas in your life, and not be held
          back by setbacks.
        </p>
        <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
        <p>
          Not surprised by much at all as it makes sense from a logical
          standpoint. I guess it may seem foreign because we grow up with a
          particular belief and may never learn or be willing to learn about a
          growth mindset.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I try to practice a growth mindset on a daily basis which stemmed from
          my own expectations of where I wanted to be in life and that lead to
          my own research into the subject. I am currently reading a book called
          &quot;Everything Is Figureoutable&quot; that looks at a growth mindset
          in how to apply it to your home and worklife.

        <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
        <h4>
          Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence
          your learning plan and strategy
        </h4>
        <p>
          My reasearch has reaffirmed that establishing a practice regimen will
          benefit me in the long run as the skills we new concepts are
          introduced daily and will continue due to the format of a bootcamp. I
          will look into more effective methods to get as much value as
          possible.
