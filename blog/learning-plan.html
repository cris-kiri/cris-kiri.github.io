        <h3>Learning Plan - Foundations</h3>
        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          To put it simply, I want to be a web developer and eventually branch
          into videogame development. Within the first two weeks of this course,
          I truly have a desire to be a web developer although I grew up always
          wanting to make videogames. I am unsure whether I want to build a web
          development business as I see working with an experienced team will
          benefit my growth as one.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an aside, I want to develop content that first and foremost,
          excites people. Getting people to engage with technology not only in
          ways they could not have fathomed but to challenge their core and
          become a better person for it.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <p>Strengths:</p>
        <ul class="body-list">
          <li>
            I have a constant drive to learn, explore and expand in new
            directions because systems can always be improved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Breaking down a problem or seeing how parts of a system fit comes
            second nature to me.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a topic or project gets my attention, I have this acute focus in
            pursuing every avenue to learn as much as I can.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Limitations:</p>
        <ul class="body-list">
          <li>
            I have a tendency to get lost in details that can be inconsequential
            to a particular goal i'm striving for
          </li>
          <li>
            If I don’t have an interest in a topic or project, good luck in
            getting the best out of me.
          </li>
          <li>
            I can get frustrated if I cannot grasp some particular subject
            material.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I would love to work on my confidence in addressing people in a more
          public forum. Being an introvert, I would normally not say anything
          unless addressed. I can do it on the odd occasion. Maybe some time
          spent on writing more creatively and effectively.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I will strive to conduct myself in a respectful and kind manner to my
          fellow learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
          I will enact strong listening skills and be attentive to the feelings
          of those I interact with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I aim to study from 9.30am to 5pm and between 7pm to 9.30pm each day,
          from Monday to Saturday, to cover as much material as I need and work
          on any projects or any further learning. I have set aside two hours on
          Sunday to finish any last minute work and spend time to prepare for
          the week ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently using Toggl to keep track of my overall spent time and
          also use the pomodoro technique to work in 25 minute bursts with a 5
          minute break in between. Stretching is an important part of that
          break.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, I mostly bottled up my feelings and I became my own worst
          enemy because of it. So reaching out to my support network and having
          a discussion or saying what's on my mind will help ease that. Learning
          when to step away from problems is paramount and not dwelling on any
          frustrations.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h4>
        <p>
          I will lean on the support of my facilitators and fellow learners
          through communicating on Discord or setting up a chat to work through
          any issues I am currently experiencing.
        </p>
        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          I expect the Facilitation team to put the learning of the students
          front and center whilst maintaining integrity for themselves and what
          they represent. I also expect the team to simply be respectful. This
          is all I expect.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I have no formal commitments and will devote as much time as needed
          for me to successfully complete this course.

        <h3>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h3>
        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          First off, let me say that I want to ensure that what I learn during
          Dev Academy is applied in a professional environment, regardless of
          any fun projects I may build. I did mention being a videogame
          developer previously, but I now feel a greater need to discover how
          web development translates to the real world and then how to apply
          that to the greater benefit of my community. With great power comes
          greater responsibility. I can't remember where I heard that, but it
          seems like sage advice. I think one of my uncles said it in a drunken
          stupor.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h4>
        <p>
          As I made my way through Foundations, there were some additions to my
          dynamic list of strengths and limitations, some glaring and some
          inconspicuous. My process for problem solving is under constant
          scrutiny, and that could be good or bad depending on what refinements
          I make. I am hoping this will aid me in completing my work, even if it
          is purely from a technical standpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are being completely honest, I compare myself to others, much to
          my detriment. It doesn't help that we are bombarded by ads every time
          we walk in public or scroll through social media, reminding us to take
          another supplement, wear the latest fashion trend, or buy a gym
          membership. I have to be comfortable with my abilities and only
          improve in a safe and affirmative manner.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be, and what would you like to see developed in yourself while at
          Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          My biggest non-technical challenge in Bootcamp will be how I will
          handle the symptoms of my ADHD. Living with ADHD is tough, and coming
          up with my own plan hasn't worked in the past (on numerous occasions),
          so the best tactic, I feel, is enlisting a specialist who can help
          formulate effective strategies to positively impact the traits I need
          to be successful while counteracting the behaviors that work against
          my well-being. This has far-reaching implications for the
          relationships in my life and how I shine the spotlight on myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to get back to a respectable level of health, as it tends
          to take a backseat, especially when I get heavily involved in a field
          of interest that captures my imagination. Too many times I will create
          a plan to work on my fitness or to eat well among other areas I can
          fit in, and yet I find myself back at square one. My expectation is
          that it will have a flow-on effect and improve my life in more ways
          than one.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many other areas to consider, but those challenges have an
          immediate effect on my chance of success in this course.
        </p>
        <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
        <p>
          Judging from what I have experienced so far, I have no reason to
          expect anything but great support from the Bootcamp team. I have no
          real way of knowing, still I would rather be an optimist than the
          opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading ahead in the handbook has revealed that students will work
          collaboratively on many projects, so I imagine adding support to
          facilitate working together both locally and in remote environments. I
          am more independent than most, though, and don't really have
          expectations beyond what is deemed standard, so take this with a grain
          of salt.
        </p>
        <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
        <p>
          As long as I put a plan in place for each day on how I will manage my
          workload and remind myself why I am here on this course, I can't see
          myself failing. My existing plan currently has detailed time blocks
          for study, free time, and managing my day-to-day activities. I intend
          to use week 6 to refine this plan and seek guidance from facilitators
          about what support they can offer me in achieving my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to always be learning, yet not so much that I lose sight of who
          I am and my intentions in this world.
