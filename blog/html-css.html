        <p>
          Let's start by explaining what is a class and what is an id... Take a
          school. Each school has many staff members that contribute to the
          running of it and each have member has different attributes defining
          who they are as a person and requirements that determine how they can
          best deliver the teaching curriculum to their classes. Some staff
          teach students, some may run the cafeteria to feed the many hungry
          mouths, while a lone caretaker keeps the premises in tip-top shape and
          presentable. There can be many members with the same role, while there
          can be those with a role no-one else should have ie there can be many
          teachers but only one Principal and only one caretaker. In HTML & CSS,
          classes can be applied to many elements to give them different
          properties, while an id is given to a single element because you want
          it to standout. Below is an example:
        </p>
        <p>HTML</p>
        <pre>
  &lt;div class="teacher" id="principal"&gt;Mr Skinner&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="teacher"&gt;Mrs Crabapple&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="cafeteria-worker"&gt;Lunchlady Doris&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="caretaker"&gt;Groundskeeper Willy&lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>CSS</p>
        <pre>
  .teacher {
    mood: auto; 
    salary: 50%;
  } 
  .cafeteria-worker { 
    mood: grumpy;
    uniform: apron;
  }
  #principal { 
    mood: chirpy;
    salary: none;
  }
  #caretaker { 
    mood: on-edge;
    body-odor: aye; 
  }
        </pre>
        <p>
          As you can see in the example, elements are not resticted to just one
          class or id. To tell you the truth, this rule where an id must belong
          to a single element is not enforced but we'll now look at some reasons
          as to why you may not want to. Best practices It is best to use a
          class when you have elements that share styling and use an id for an
          element that is unique to every page such as a header or a footer.
          Imagine having to apply styling to each element you can save so much
          time with reuse alone. How to manage your code is definitely a topic
          worth investing in. If you are looking at using Javascript with your
          website, it is in your best interest to use classes and ids as
          intended as specific functions in Javascript may not give the desired
          output if this rule is not adhered to. Well I don't want to take up
          any more of your time so get out there and make your mark on the
          world.
